Description: Provides an equivalent measure of partial correlation coefficients for high-dimensional Gaussian Graphical Models to learn and visualize the underlying relationships between variables from single or multiple datasets. You can refer to <doi:10.1080/01621459.2015.1012391> for more detail. Based on this method, the package also provides the method for constructing networks for Next Generation Sequencing Data.
