Description: Provides an equivalent measure of partial correlation coefficients for high-dimensional Gaussian Graphical Models to learn and visualize the underlying relationships between variables from single or multiple datasets. You can refer to Liang, F., Song, Q. and Qiu, P. (2015) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2015.1012391> for more detail. Based on this method, the package also provides the method for constructing networks for Next Generation Sequencing Data. Besides, it includes the method for jointly estimating Gaussian Graphical Models of multiple datasets.
